    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This traditional honey almond cake, known for its irresistible combination of soft, buttery layers and a luscious honey-almond topping, is a true treat for dessert enthusiasts.
         The cake's name, Bienenstich, translates to "bee sting," alluding to the sweet, sticky honey glaze that crowns the deliciously golden surface. Each forkful reveals a harmonious
          blend of rich pastry cream nestled between layers of tender cake, creating a symphony of flavors and textures. Bienenstich Kuchen is not just a cake; it's a celebration of 
          Germany's sweet culinary heritage. Whip up this decadent masterpiece in your own kitchen and savor the essence of German baking perfection! The cake takes about 1 1/2 hours
           of total hands-on time, 50 minutes to bake, and a few hours to chill the pastry cream and cool the cake. To make things a little easier, you might want to make the cake 
           and/or the filling the day before assembling it. The original recipe can be found

        <li>500 grams all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>100 grams unsalted butter</li>
        <li>75 grams honey</li>
        <li>226 milliliters milk, lukewarm but not hot</li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Almond Topping:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>50 grams sugar</li>
        <li>125 grams honey</li>
        <li>125 grams unsalted butter</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Make the Pastry Cream</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the half-and-half, sugar, and vanilla bean. Stir constantly to dissolve the sugar.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the 2 eggs, egg yolk, flour, and salt until smooth.</li>
        <li>Temper the egg mixture by adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the hot half-and-half mixture to the eggs, whisking constantly.</li>
        <li>Pouring in a thin stream and whisking constantly, stir the egg mixture into the saucepan with the remaining hot half-and-half mixture.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring until the mixture starts to thicken; do not let it boil. When it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, remove it from heat.</li>
        <li>Pour the pastry cream into a bowl set on top of an ice-cube-filled bowl. Stir several times.</li>
        <li> Place plastic wrap over the pastry cream so that it touches the surface to prevent a skin from forming. When the pastry cream has cooled down some, 
            remove it from the ice bath and store it in the refrigerator until ready to assemble.

            Note: The heavy whipping cream will be incorporated into the pastry cream when assembling the cake.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Make the Cake Dough</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the instant yeast and flour.</li>
        <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the butter and honey in the microwave until just melted. Stir in the lukewarm milk.
             Add the egg and salt and whisk well. This mixture should have a temperature of 38 C.</li>
        <li>Add the liquid mixture to the bowl of flour and yeast. Mix on low in a stand mixer (or with a wooden spoon) until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead until the dough becomes smooth and pliable and comes away from the bowl.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a ball, oil the surface, and place in a clean bowl.</li>
        <li>Cover with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 40 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Make the Almond Topping</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, honey, and butter. Heat and stir until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a 
            boil. Continue boiling for several minutes, stirring constantly so it doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Add the almonds and vanilla extract, stirring to coat.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and cool until lukewarm.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Bake the Cake</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 C. Coat a 13 x 9-inch pan with cooking spray. Roll the risen dough out into a 13 x 9-inch rectangle.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in the pan, pushing it so the edges are slightly higher than the middle.</li>
        <li>Spread the lukewarm almond topping evenly over the top of the dough.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45 to 50 minutes. Test for doneness by sticking a toothpick in the center of the cake; if it comes out clean, the cake is done. Remove from
             oven and let the cake cool completely. Using 2 spatulas, carefully remove the entire cake from the pan, moving it to a waxed paper-coated surface or cutting board.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assemble the Cake</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Whip 1 cup heavy whipping cream until very stiff but stop whipping before it becomes clumpy and starts to turn into butter.</li>
        <li>Stir a third of the whipped cream into the cold pastry cream to lighten it, then carefully fold the rest into the pastry cream, trying not to deflate the volume.</li>
        <li>Using a serrated knife, cut the cake in half horizontally.</li>
        <li>Remove the top half and set it aside. Spread the pastry cream over top of the bottom of the cake.</li>
        <li>Put the top back on the cake. Serve immediately or place in the refrigerator, which helps the pastry cream set up.</li>
    </ol>
